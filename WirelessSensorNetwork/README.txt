/**
     * Simulates node localization in 2D/3D space and returns average distance error from n simulations
     * and the fraction of localized nodes
     *
     * Can do iterative and non-iterative localization
     *
     * Can do degree determination heuristic or distance determination heuristic
     *
     * Grid size, radio range, radio range error, number of known and unknown nodes, iterative or non-iterative
     * algorithm is chosen manually
